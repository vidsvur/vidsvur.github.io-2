### More Information

I am a first year PhD student, interested in plant-parasitic interactions, and the evolutionary significance behind this relationship! I will be working in Dr. Jill Wegrzyn's [lab](https://plantcompgenomics.com/).

I have done my Master's in Plant Biotechnology from [Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl/), and had the oppotunity to do my thesis at the [Lab of Nematology](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Chair-groups/Plant-Sciences/Laboratory-of-Nematology.htm), and Dr. Hans Helder was my supervisor.

I did my Bachelor's in Biotechnology in Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. My bachelor thesis was supervised by Dr. Babu S.
